        <h2>Tale #1: Mars and the Sun </h2>
        <p>
            Did you know that the sunset on mars actually appears to be blue? This is due to the high richness of Carbon Dioxide on Mars, and its iron rich atmosphere.

            Quite amazing, right?

        <h2>Tale #2: Comets visit Earth frequently</h2>
        <p>
            Reports have shown that comets about the size of a car enter the Earth's atmosphere every year, but burn up before they can even touch the ground. What an amazing invisible defense that the Earth has in place for us!
